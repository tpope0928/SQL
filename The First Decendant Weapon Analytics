--This is my first data inquiry on my own.--
-- I found weapon data from a videogame I play, The First Decendant--
--I used the data to help find the best weapons in the game--
-- Data was found from tfd_calculator by mogitdb https://github.com/mogitdb/tfd_calculator/tree/main--

--First, I created a table to insert the weapon data into--
--I  then preformed analytics on the data using SQL.--
